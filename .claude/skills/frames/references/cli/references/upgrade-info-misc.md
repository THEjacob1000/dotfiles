# info, compositions, timeline, benchmark, asset preprocessing

Catch-all reference for commands that don't fit the main dev loop.

## info

```bash
frames.info {"project": "/absolute/path/to/project"}                   # project metadata
frames.info {"project": "/absolute/path/to/project"}        # specific project
```

Prints **project** metadata: name, resolution, duration, element counts by type, track count, and total project size. Project-level — not environment. For environment health use `doctor`.

## upgrade

Upgrading is not available in Numen: the `frames.*` tools ship with Numen itself and the skills are projected by `numen sync`.

## timeline

```bash
frames.timeline {"project": "/absolute/path/to/project"}          # tracks and clips as a table with bars
```

Reach for `timeline` instead of opening `index.html` and each `data-composition-src` file when you need to know what is on the timeline: which clips exist, when they start and end, what they play, and how loud. It reads the project's files statically (no browser).

Text output is `timeline <N>s`, then one block per track kind (`video`, `graphics`, `captions`, `audio`) with one row per clip of that kind, ordered by absolute start:

```
graphics (2: 1 top-level, 1 nested)
  |██████                                  | sec-connector 0-6.7s src=compositions/connector-morph.html
  |██████████████                          | box 15.67-17.99s (local 0-2.32s) nested in sec-connector compositions/connector-morph.html
audio (1)
  | █                                      | vo 1.6-3.6s src=vo.mp3 vol=0.5 group=vo volume[0:0.2 2:1]
```

- The bar is 40 columns over the whole timeline. Times are seconds.
- `src=`, `vol=`, `rate=` (playback rate, only when not 1), `group=` (audio group), and `<target>[t:v ...]` (automation lane points, `t` in seconds from the clip start) appear only when the clip has them.
- The header counts every clip of that kind, nested ones included: `video (6: 2 top-level, 4 nested)`. The list is in absolute order, so the Nth row is the Nth clip of that kind on the main timeline. A clip inside a sub-composition prints its absolute start-end, then `(local <start>-<end>s)` (time inside that sub-composition), then `nested in <host row id> <file that declares it>`. Only one level of nesting is read: a sub-composition inside a sub-composition is listed as a row saying `children=unread`, and the clips inside it are not counted.
- With no `data-duration`/`data-end`, a media row still gets a resolved length and says where it came from: `duration=media` means ffprobe measured the source (with playback start and rate applied); `duration=default` means an `img` got the 3s default; `duration=inferred` means a composition host summed its children; `pending: <reason>` (dotted bar, `duration` 0) means the source could not be probed (missing file, remote `src`, ffprobe error). A non-media leaf with nothing to resolve prints no source.
- `lanes unreadable: ...` means the clip's `data-automation` or `data-fx-chain` did not parse; fix the attribute.

`--json` prints `{ timeline: { duration, tracks: [{ kind, rows: [...] }] } }`. A track's `rows` are every clip of that kind, nested ones included, by `absStart`; read them, never only the top level. Each row has `id`, `kind` (tag), `trackKind`, `start`, `duration`, `end` (local to the row's own file), **`absStart`, `absEnd`, `file`** (main-timeline time and the project-relative file that declares the clip — use these, not `start`/`end`, to compare clips across nesting), `trackIndex`, `src`, `sourceFile`, `volume`, `lanes`, `playbackRate`, `audioGroup`, `durationAuthored`, **`durationSource`** (`"authored" | "media" | "default" | "inner" | "pending"`, or `null` for a non-media leaf with nothing to resolve), **`pendingReason`** (why nothing resolved; `null` unless `durationSource` is `"pending"`), `laneError`, **`index`** (the row's position in its kind's `rows`; a position, not an id), **`nested`** (declared inside a sub-composition), **`host`** (plain id of the row that hosts a nested clip, else `null`), **`hostRow`** (`{kind, index}` of that host row), and `children` (`{kind, index}` pointers to the sub-composition's clips, one level; every clip is already a full row in its kind's `rows`, so nothing needs following).

### Query one-liners (jq)

Save the `frames.timeline` result to `timeline.json`, then:

```bash
# 1. what plays at absolute time T=12.5
jq --argjson t 12.5 '[.timeline.tracks[].rows[] | select(.absStart<=$t and .absEnd>$t)]' timeline.json
# 2. find a clip by id or src -> file, track, absStart, absEnd
jq --arg q tsfx-pet2 '[.timeline.tracks[].rows[] | select(.id==$q or .src==$q)] | .[] | {file,trackKind,absStart,absEnd}' timeline.json
# 3. every clip of one kind, nested included, in absolute order
jq --arg k video '.timeline.tracks[] | select(.kind==$k).rows[] | {id,absStart,absEnd}' timeline.json
# 4. gaps and overlaps within a kind (positive = gap, negative = overlap)
jq --arg k video '(.timeline.tracks[] | select(.kind==$k).rows) as $r|[range(0;($r|length)-1)|{a:$r[.].id,b:$r[.+1].id,delta:($r[.+1].absStart-$r[.].absEnd)}]' timeline.json
# 5. the Nth clip of a kind by absolute start (N=2)
jq --arg k video --argjson n 2 '.timeline.tracks[] | select(.kind==$k).rows[$n-1] | {index,id,absStart,file,nested}' timeline.json
```

## compositions, docs

```bash
frames.info {"project": "/absolute/path/to/project"}           # project metadata and every composition
```

`frames.info` lists every `data-composition-id` in the project (including sub-comps) with duration, resolution, and element count.

Upstream's `docs` command has no Numen tool. Read the frames skills directly: `/frames → references/core.md` for data attributes and compositions, `/frames → references/animation.md` for GSAP, `/frames → references/cli.md` for rendering and troubleshooting, and the examples under `/frames → references/registry.md`.

## benchmark

```bash
frames.benchmark {"project": "/absolute/path/to/project"}              # run the preset matrix in current project
frames.benchmark {"project": "/absolute/path/to/project"}   # specific project
frames.benchmark {"project": "/absolute/path/to/project", "runs": 5}     # repeat each config N times (default 3)
```

Renders the project with 5 preset configurations — `30fps draft 2w`, `30fps standard 2w`, `30fps high 2w`, `30fps standard 4w`, `60fps standard 4w` — and prints a comparison of render speed and output file size. Use it to find the fastest acceptable preset for your machine. Not a single-render-with-stage-breakdown.

## Asset Preprocessing

```bash
frames.tts
frames.transcribe
```

These produce assets (narration audio, word-level transcripts) that get dropped into a composition. Background removal (transparent video) is not available in Numen.

For voice selection, Whisper model rules, output format choice, and the TTS → transcript → captions chain, invoke the `frames references/media-use.md` skill. This skill stays focused on the dev loop.

## Remaining harness usage

Upstream's `usage` command reads the agent harness's remaining allowance from the provider and is not available in Numen. Report allowance as unknown; do not guess it.
