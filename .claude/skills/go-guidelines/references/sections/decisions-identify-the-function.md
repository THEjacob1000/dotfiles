## Useful test failures

<a id="TOC-UsefulTestFailures"></a>

It should be possible to diagnose a test's failure without reading the test's
source. Tests should fail with helpful messages detailing:

*   What caused the failure
*   What inputs resulted in an error
*   The actual result
*   What was expected

Specific conventions for achieving this goal are outlined below.

### Identify the function

In most tests, failure messages should include the name of the function that
failed, even though it seems obvious from the name of the test function.
Specifically, your failure message should be `YourFunc(%v) = %v, want %v`
instead of just `got %v, want %v`.
