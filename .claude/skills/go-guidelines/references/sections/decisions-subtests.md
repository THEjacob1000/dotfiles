### Subtests

The standard Go testing library offers a facility to [define subtests]. This
allows flexibility in setup and cleanup, controlling parallelism, and test
filtering. Subtests can be useful (particularly for table-driven tests), but
using them is not mandatory. See also the
[Go blog post about subtests](https://blog.golang.org/subtests).

Subtests should not depend on the execution of other cases for success or
initial state, because subtests are expected to be able to be run individually
with using `go test -run` flags or with Bazel [test filter] expressions.
