## Useful test failures

<a id="TOC-UsefulTestFailures"></a>

It should be possible to diagnose a test's failure without reading the test's
source. Tests should fail with helpful messages detailing:

*   What caused the failure
*   What inputs resulted in an error
*   The actual result
*   What was expected

Specific conventions for achieving this goal are outlined below.

### Keep going

Tests should keep going for as long as possible, even after a failure, in order
to print out all of the failed checks in a single run. This way, a developer who
is fixing the failing test doesn't have to re-run the test after fixing each bug
to find the next bug.

Prefer calling `t.Error` over `t.Fatal` for reporting a mismatch. When comparing
several different properties of a function's output, use `t.Error` for each of
those comparisons.

```go
// Good:
gotMean, gotVariance, err := MyDistribution(input)
if err != nil {
  t.Fatalf("MyDistribution(%v) returned unexpected error: %v", input, err)
}
if diff := cmp.Diff(wantMean, gotMean); diff != "" {
  t.Errorf("MyDistribution(%v) returned unexpected difference in mean value (-want +got):\n%s", input, diff)
}
if diff := cmp.Diff(wantVariance, gotVariance); diff != "" {
  t.Errorf("MyDistribution(%v) returned unexpected difference in variance value (-want +got):\n%s", input, diff)
}
```

Calling `t.Fatal` is primarily useful for reporting an unexpected condition
(such as an error or output mismatch) when subsequent failures would be
meaningless or even mislead the investigator. Note how the code below calls
`t.Fatalf` and *then* `t.Errorf`:

```go
// Good:
gotEncoded := Encode(input)
if gotEncoded != wantEncoded {
  t.Fatalf("Encode(%q) = %q, want %q", input, gotEncoded, wantEncoded)
  // It doesn't make sense to decode from unexpected encoded input.
}
gotDecoded, err := Decode(gotEncoded)
if err != nil {
  t.Fatalf("Decode(%q) returned unexpected error: %v", gotEncoded, err)
}
if gotDecoded != input {
  t.Errorf("Decode(%q) = %q, want %q", gotEncoded, gotDecoded, input)
}
```

For table-driven test, consider using subtests and use `t.Fatal` rather than
`t.Error` and `continue`. See also
