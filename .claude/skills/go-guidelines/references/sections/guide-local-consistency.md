## Core guidelines

These guidelines collect the most important aspects of Go style that all Go code
is expected to follow. We expect that these principles be learned and followed
by the time readability is granted. These are not expected to change frequently,
and new additions will have to clear a high bar.

The guidelines below expand on the recommendations in [Effective Go], which
provide a common baseline for Go code across the entire community.

### Local consistency

Where the style guide has nothing to say about a particular point of style,
authors are free to choose the style that they prefer, unless the code in close
proximity (usually within the same file or package, but sometimes within a team
or project directory) has taken a consistent stance on the issue.

Examples of **valid** local style considerations:

*   Use of `%s` or `%v` for formatted printing of errors
*   Usage of buffered channels in lieu of mutexes

Examples of **invalid** local style considerations:

*   Line length restrictions for code
*   Use of assertion-based testing libraries

If the local style disagrees with the style guide but the readability impact is
limited to one file, it will generally be surfaced in a code review for which a
consistent fix would be outside the scope of the CL in question. At that point,
it is appropriate to file a bug to track the fix.

If a change would worsen an existing style deviation, expose it in more API
surfaces, expand the number of files in which the deviation is present, or
introduce an actual bug, then local consistency is no longer a valid
justification for violating the style guide for new code. In these cases, it is
appropriate for the author to clean up the existing codebase in the same CL,
perform a refactor in advance of the current CL, or find an alternative that at
least does not make the local problem worse.
