### Synchronous functions

<a id="TOC-SynchronousFunctions"></a>

Synchronous functions return their results directly and finish any callbacks or
channel operations before returning. Prefer synchronous functions over
asynchronous functions.

Synchronous functions keep goroutines localized within a call. This helps to
reason about their lifetimes, and avoid leaks and data races. Synchronous
functions are also easier to test, since the caller can pass an input and check
the output without the need for polling or synchronization.

If necessary, the caller can add concurrency by calling the function in a
separate goroutine. However, it is quite difficult (sometimes impossible) to
remove unnecessary concurrency at the caller side.
