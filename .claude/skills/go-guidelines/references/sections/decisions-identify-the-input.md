## Useful test failures

<a id="TOC-UsefulTestFailures"></a>

It should be possible to diagnose a test's failure without reading the test's
source. Tests should fail with helpful messages detailing:

*   What caused the failure
*   What inputs resulted in an error
*   The actual result
*   What was expected

Specific conventions for achieving this goal are outlined below.

### Identify the input

In most tests, failure messages should include the function inputs if they are
short. If the relevant properties of the inputs are not obvious (for example,
because the inputs are large or opaque), you should name your test cases with a
description of what's being tested and print the description as part of your
error message.
