### Channel direction

Specify [channel direction] where possible.

```go
// Good:
// sum computes the sum of all of the values. It reads from the channel until
// the channel is closed.
func sum(values <-chan int) int {
    // ...
}
```

This prevents casual programming errors that are possible without specification:

```go
// Bad:
func sum(values chan int) (out int) {
    for v := range values {
        out += v
    }
    // values must already be closed for this code to be reachable, which means
    // a second close triggers a panic.
    close(values)
}
```

When the direction is specified, the compiler catches simple errors like this.
It also helps to convey a measure of ownership to the type.
