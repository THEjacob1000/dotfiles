## Useful test failures

<a id="TOC-UsefulTestFailures"></a>

It should be possible to diagnose a test's failure without reading the test's
source. Tests should fail with helpful messages detailing:

*   What caused the failure
*   What inputs resulted in an error
*   The actual result
*   What was expected

Specific conventions for achieving this goal are outlined below.

### Full structure comparisons

If your function returns a struct (or any data type with multiple fields such as
slices, arrays, and maps), avoid writing test code that performs a hand-coded
field-by-field comparison of the struct. Instead, construct the data that you're
expecting your function to return, and compare directly using a
[deep comparison].

**Note:** This does not apply if your data contains irrelevant fields that
obscure the intention of the test.

If your struct needs to be compared for approximate (or equivalent kind of
semantic) equality or it contains fields that cannot be compared for equality
(e.g., if one of the fields is an `io.Reader`), tweaking a [`cmp.Diff`] or
[`cmp.Equal`] comparison with [`cmpopts`] options such as
[`cmpopts.IgnoreInterfaces`] may meet your needs
([example](https://play.golang.org/p/vrCUNVfxsvF)).

If your function returns multiple return values, you don't need to wrap those in
a struct before comparing them. Just compare the return values individually and
print them.

```go
// Good:
val, multi, tail, err := strconv.UnquoteChar(`\"Fran & Freddie's Diner\"`, '"')
if err != nil {
  t.Fatalf(...)
}
if val != `"` {
  t.Errorf(...)
}
if multi {
  t.Errorf(...)
}
if tail != `Fran & Freddie's Diner"` {
  t.Errorf(...)
}
```
