## String concatenation

There are several ways to concatenate strings in Go. Some examples include:

*   The "+" operator
*   `fmt.Sprintf`
*   `strings.Builder`
*   `text/template`
*   `safehtml/template`

Though there is no one-size-fits-all rule for which to choose, the following
guidance outlines when each method is preferred.

### Prefer `strings.Builder` for constructing a string piecemeal

Prefer using `strings.Builder` when building a string bit-by-bit.
`strings.Builder` takes amortized linear time, whereas "+" and `fmt.Sprintf`
take quadratic time when called sequentially to form a larger string.

```go
// Good:
b := new(strings.Builder)
for i, d := range digitsOfPi {
    fmt.Fprintf(b, "the %d digit of pi is: %d\n", i, d)
}
str := b.String()
```
