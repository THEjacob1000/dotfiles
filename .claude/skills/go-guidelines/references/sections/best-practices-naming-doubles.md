## Naming

### Test double and helper packages

There are several disciplines you can apply to [naming] packages and types that
provide test helpers and especially [test doubles]. A test double could be a
stub, fake, mock, or spy.

These examples mostly use stubs. Update your names accordingly if your code uses
fakes or another kind of test double.

Suppose you have a well-focused package providing production code similar to
this:

```go
package creditcard

import (
    "errors"

    "path/to/money"
)

// ErrDeclined indicates that the issuer declines the charge.
var ErrDeclined = errors.New("creditcard: declined")

// Card contains information about a credit card, such as its issuer,
// expiration, and limit.
type Card struct {
    // omitted
}

// Service allows you to perform operations with credit cards against external
// payment processor vendors like charge, authorize, reimburse, and subscribe.
type Service struct {
    // omitted
}

func (s *Service) Charge(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```
