## Naming

### Test double and helper packages

There are several disciplines you can apply to [naming] packages and types that
provide test helpers and especially [test doubles]. A test double could be a
stub, fake, mock, or spy.

These examples mostly use stubs. Update your names accordingly if your code uses
fakes or another kind of test double.

[test doubles]: https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch13.html#basic_concepts

Suppose you have a well-focused package providing production code similar to
this:

```go
package creditcard

import (
    "errors"

    "path/to/money"
)

// ErrDeclined indicates that the issuer declines the charge.
var ErrDeclined = errors.New("creditcard: declined")

// Card contains information about a credit card, such as its issuer,
// expiration, and limit.
type Card struct {
    // omitted
}

// Service allows you to perform operations with credit cards against external
// payment processor vendors like charge, authorize, reimburse, and subscribe.
type Service struct {
    // omitted
}

func (s *Service) Charge(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```

#### Multiple doubles for multiple types

But now suppose that `package creditcard` contains multiple types worth creating
doubles for, as seen below with `Service` and `StoredValue`:

```go
package creditcard

type Service struct {
    // omitted
}

type Card struct {
    // omitted
}

// StoredValue manages customer credit balances.  This applies when returned
// merchandise is credited to a customer's local account instead of processed
// by the credit issuer.  For this reason, it is implemented as a separate
// service.
type StoredValue struct {
    // omitted
}

func (s *StoredValue) Credit(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```

In this case, more explicit test double naming is sensible:

```go
// Good:
type StubService struct{}

func (StubService) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }

type StubStoredValue struct{}

func (StubStoredValue) Credit(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }
```
