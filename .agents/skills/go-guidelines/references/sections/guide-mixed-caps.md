## Core guidelines

These guidelines collect the most important aspects of Go style that all Go code
is expected to follow. We expect that these principles be learned and followed
by the time readability is granted. These are not expected to change frequently,
and new additions will have to clear a high bar.

The guidelines below expand on the recommendations in [Effective Go], which
provide a common baseline for Go code across the entire community.

### MixedCaps

Go source code uses `MixedCaps` or `mixedCaps` (camel case) rather than
underscores (snake case) when writing multi-word names.

This applies even when it breaks conventions in other languages. For example, a
constant is `MaxLength` (not `MAX_LENGTH`) if exported and `maxLength` (not
`max_length`) if unexported.

Local variables are considered [unexported] for the purpose of choosing the
initial capitalization.
