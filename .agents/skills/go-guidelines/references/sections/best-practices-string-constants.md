## String concatenation

There are several ways to concatenate strings in Go. Some examples include:

*   The "+" operator
*   `fmt.Sprintf`
*   `strings.Builder`
*   `text/template`
*   `safehtml/template`

Though there is no one-size-fits-all rule for which to choose, the following
guidance outlines when each method is preferred.

### Constant strings

Prefer to use backticks (\`) when constructing constant, multi-line string
literals.

```go
// Good:
usage := `Usage:

custom_tool [args]`
```

```go
// Bad:
usage := "" +
  "Usage:\n" +
  "\n" +
  "custom_tool [args]"
```
