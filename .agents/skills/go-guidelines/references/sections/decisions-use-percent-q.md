### Use %q

<a id="TOC-UsePercentQ"></a>

Go's format functions (`fmt.Printf` etc.) have a `%q` verb which prints strings
inside double-quotation marks.

```go
// Good:
fmt.Printf("value %q looks like English text", someText)
```

Prefer using `%q` over doing the equivalent manually, using `%s`:

```go
// Bad:
fmt.Printf("value \"%s\" looks like English text", someText)
// Avoid manually wrapping strings with single-quotes too:
fmt.Printf("value '%s' looks like English text", someText)
```

Using `%q` is recommended in output intended for humans where the input value
could possibly be empty or contain control characters. It can be very hard to
notice a silent empty string, but `""` stands out clearly as such.
