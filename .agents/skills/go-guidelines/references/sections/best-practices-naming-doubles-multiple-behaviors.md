## Naming

### Test double and helper packages

There are several disciplines you can apply to [naming] packages and types that
provide test helpers and especially [test doubles]. A test double could be a
stub, fake, mock, or spy.

These examples mostly use stubs. Update your names accordingly if your code uses
fakes or another kind of test double.

[test doubles]: https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch13.html#basic_concepts

Suppose you have a well-focused package providing production code similar to
this:

```go
package creditcard

import (
    "errors"

    "path/to/money"
)

// ErrDeclined indicates that the issuer declines the charge.
var ErrDeclined = errors.New("creditcard: declined")

// Card contains information about a credit card, such as its issuer,
// expiration, and limit.
type Card struct {
    // omitted
}

// Service allows you to perform operations with credit cards against external
// payment processor vendors like charge, authorize, reimburse, and subscribe.
type Service struct {
    // omitted
}

func (s *Service) Charge(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```

#### Multiple test double behaviors

When one kind of stub is not enough (for example, you also need one that always
fails), we recommend naming the stubs according to the behavior they emulate.
Here we rename `Stub` to `AlwaysCharges` and introduce a new stub called
`AlwaysDeclines`:

```go
// Good:
// AlwaysCharges stubs creditcard.Service and simulates success.
type AlwaysCharges struct{}

func (AlwaysCharges) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }

// AlwaysDeclines stubs creditcard.Service and simulates declined charges.
type AlwaysDeclines struct{}

func (AlwaysDeclines) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error {
    return creditcard.ErrDeclined
}
```
