## Commentary

The conventions around commentary (which include what to comment, what style to
use, how to provide runnable examples, etc.) are intended to support the
experience of reading the documentation of a public API. See
[Effective Go](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary) for more
information.

The best practices document's section on [documentation conventions] discusses
this further.

**Best Practice:** Use [doc preview] during development and code review to see
whether the documentation and runnable examples are useful and are presented the
way you expect them to be.

**Tip:** Godoc uses very little special formatting; lists and code snippets
should usually be indented to avoid linewrapping. Apart from indentation,
decoration should generally be avoided.

### Named result parameters

<a id="TOC-NamedResultParameters"></a>

When naming parameters, consider how function signatures appear in Godoc. The
name of the function itself and the type of the result parameters are often
sufficiently clear.

```go
// Good:
func (n *Node) Parent1() *Node
func (n *Node) Parent2() (*Node, error)
```

If a function returns two or more parameters of the same type, adding names can
be useful.

```go
// Good:
func (n *Node) Children() (left, right *Node, err error)
```

If the caller must take action on particular result parameters, naming them can
help suggest what the action is:

```go
// Good:
// WithTimeout returns a context that will be canceled no later than d duration
// from now.
//
// The caller must arrange for the returned cancel function to be called when
// the context is no longer needed to prevent a resource leak.
func WithTimeout(parent Context, d time.Duration) (ctx Context, cancel func())
```

In the code above, cancellation is a particular action a caller must take.
However, were the result parameters written as `(Context, func())` alone, it
would be unclear what is meant by "cancel function".

Don't use named result parameters when the names produce
[unnecessary repetition](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/60d2ac7d89ad526937a52571e5e439e01f0af673/go/decisions.md#repetitive-with-type).

```go
// Bad:
func (n *Node) Parent1() (node *Node)
func (n *Node) Parent2() (node *Node, err error)
```

Don't name result parameters in order to avoid declaring a variable inside the
function. This practice results in unnecessary API verbosity at the cost of
minor implementation brevity.

[Naked returns] are acceptable only in a small function. Once it's a
medium-sized function, be explicit with your returned values. Similarly, do not
name result parameters just because it enables you to use naked returns.
[Clarity](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/60d2ac7d89ad526937a52571e5e439e01f0af673/go/guide.md#clarity) is always more important than saving a few lines in
your function.

It is always acceptable to name a result parameter if its value must be changed
in a deferred closure.

> **Tip:** Types can often be clearer than names in function signatures.
> [GoTip #38: Functions as Named Types] demonstrates this.
>
> In, [`WithTimeout`] above, the real code uses a [`CancelFunc`] instead of a
> raw `func()` in the result parameter list and requires little effort to
> document.
