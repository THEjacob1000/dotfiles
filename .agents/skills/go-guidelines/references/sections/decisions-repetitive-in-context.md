## Naming

See the naming section within [the core style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/60d2ac7d89ad526937a52571e5e439e01f0af673/go/guide.md#naming) for
overarching guidance on naming. The following sections provide further
clarification on specific areas within naming.

### Repetition

<!--
Note to future editors:

Do not use the term "stutter" to refer to cases when a name is repetitive.

A piece of Go source code should avoid unnecessary repetition. One common source
of this is repetitive names, which often include unnecessary words or repeat
their context or type. Code itself can also be unnecessarily repetitive if the
same or a similar code segment appears multiple times in close proximity.

Repetitive naming can come in many forms, including:

<a id="repetitive-in-context"></a>

#### External context vs. local names

Names that include information from their surrounding context often create extra
noise without benefit. The package name, method name, type name, function name,
import path, and even filename can all provide context that automatically
qualifies all names within.

```go
// Bad:
// In package "ads/targeting/revenue/reporting"
type AdsTargetingRevenueReport struct{}

func (p *Project) ProjectName() string
```

```go
// Good:
// In package "ads/targeting/revenue/reporting"
type Report struct{}

func (p *Project) Name() string
```

```go
// Bad:
// In package "sqldb"
type DBConnection struct{}
```

```go
// Good:
// In package "sqldb"
type Connection struct{}
```

```go
// Bad:
// In package "ads/targeting"
func Process(in *pb.FooProto) *Report {
    adsTargetingID := in.GetAdsTargetingID()
}
```

```go
// Good:
// In package "ads/targeting"
func Process(in *pb.FooProto) *Report {
    id := in.GetAdsTargetingID()
}
```

Repetition should generally be evaluated in the context of the user of the
symbol, rather than in isolation. For example, the following code has lots of
names that may be fine in some circumstances, but redundant in context:

```go
// Bad:
func (db *DB) UserCount() (userCount int, err error) {
    var userCountInt64 int64
    if dbLoadError := db.LoadFromDatabase("count(distinct users)", &userCountInt64); dbLoadError != nil {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to load user count: %s", dbLoadError)
    }
    userCount = int(userCountInt64)
    return userCount, nil
}
```

Instead, information about names that are clear from context or usage can often
be omitted:

```go
// Good:
func (db *DB) UserCount() (int, error) {
    var count int64
    if err := db.Load("count(distinct users)", &count); err != nil {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to load user count: %s", err)
    }
    return int(count), nil
}
```
